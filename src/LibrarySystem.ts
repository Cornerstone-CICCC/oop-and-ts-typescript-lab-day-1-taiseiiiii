// 📚 Create a simple Library System where users can add books, borrow books, return books, and check availability.
// 1. Create an enum called BookGenre with at least 5 book genres.
// 2. Create a type alias called Book which contains: bookId (number), title (string), author (string), genre (BookGenre), isAvailable (boolean).
// 3. Create a function called addBook which will add a new book into the library array. The function needs to return a Book object.
// 4. Create a function called borrowBook which will change the book’s availability to false if available. The return needs to be a string.
// 5. Create a function called returnBook which will change the book’s availability to true. The return needs to be a string.
// 6. Create a function called checkAvailability which will return true if the book is available and false otherwise.
// 7. Create a function called removeBook which will remove a book from the library array. The return needs to be a string.

// Test cases (Create more if needed)
console.log(addBook(1, "The Hobbit", "J.R.R. Tolkien", BookGenre.Fantasy)) // { bookId: 1, title: "The Hobbit", author: "J.R.R. Tolkien", genre: BookGenre.Fantasy, isAvailable: true }

console.log(checkAvailability(1)) // false
console.log(returnBook(1)) // "The Hobbit has been returned"
console.log(removeBook(1)) // "The Hobbit has been removed from the library"
